# MLOps on Azure
This repository contains sample code, which is used for a [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) Workshop.

In this workshop various cloud services will be used, e.g. [Azure ML Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/) and [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

## What is MLOps?
**MLOps** (a compound of "[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)" and "operations") is a practice for collaboration and communication between [data scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scientists) and operations professionals to help manage production ML lifecycle.
Similar to the [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) or [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps) approaches, MLOps looks to increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements.

## How does Azure ML help with MLOps?
Azure ML contains a number of asset management and orchestration services to help you manage the lifecycle of your model training & deployment workflows.

With Azure ML + Azure DevOps you can effectively and cohesively manage your datasets, experiments, models, and ML-infused applications.
